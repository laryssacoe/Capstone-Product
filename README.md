## Troubleshooting

**Common errors may be related to React and Next.js version mismatches.**
- Make sure your `package.json` uses compatible versions (e.g., React 19 and the latest Next.js for @react-three/fiber@9.x).
- If you see dependency or runtime errors, verify your requirements and update dependencies as needed.
- Run `npm install` after changing versions.

If you encounter issues, check the documentation for each major dependency and ensure your environment matches the required versions.
